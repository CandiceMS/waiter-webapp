use table to display shifts to be selected
th as day name, tr + td as checkbox

form action = /waiter/:{{username}}

SEE Array.isArray(req.body.username) 

"insert into " resolves error "id of undefined"
pay attention to sequence of processing and async/await

change value of day to it's id instead of day name

also use:
for(let weekday of weekdays)
